# DSFC_Project

This was my DSFC branch's project from last year during the second semester. We first surveyed the student population on a variety of mental health and stress-related topics, then compiled and cleaned the data. Finally, we ran regressions and other tests on our data. At the end of the year, we presented our findings to the school administration, and this year, we are working with them to plan health lessons centered around the data. This way, our school policy is personalized for our community, as we have encouraged the administration to focus on specific aspects of student life, including sleep, that seemed to affect most of our peers.

We've used this study as an example for our other branches, three of which are in the United States and two of which are international.
